### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a data set using python, pandas, functions and SQLAlchemy. We are to find the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to convince our business partner that a surf and ice cream shop can be sustainable year-round.


### Results:
There are three major points I can take away from the analysis. 

* The average temperature in June and December is only sepperated by 4 degrees. With June being 75 and December being 71. A difference of four degrees would not be enough to scare me away from the winter months.

* The minimum temperature in June was 64, where as the minimum temperature in December was 56. That is quite a difference, which means there may be some slower days in December. 

* The maximum temperature in June was 85, the maximum in December was 83. This tells me there is really hot days all year round which can lead to busier days any month of the year. 

This is the temperature summary for June.


This is the temperature sumamry for December.

### Summary:
After completing the analysis, I feel confident making my pitch to W.Avy. I see no signs that a surf and ice cream shop would not be successful year round in Oahu. The temperature is nice year round, with a mix of hot days and some less hot to create a nice balance. If I were to make two more querries to back up my summary, I would look into the amount of precipitation for the months of June and December. Also, since it is a surf shop I would be interested in finding out the wind levels for the months of June and December.
